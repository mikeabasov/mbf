[![How to Dominate Social Media with HootSuite [VIDEO]](http://marketingbeforefunding.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/highres_177627112-1-590x355.jpeg)](http://marketingbeforefunding.com/2012/11/14/dominate-social-media/)

Social media can be extremely powerful for business. Everyone knows that by now. But...

…it can also be a **HUGE TIME SUCK**.

The main reason is that, in order to be successful, you probably need to manage accounts across multiple networks, maintain a consistent flow of updates, discover new content, engage with your audience, and so on and so forth...

And all of that needs to be done **_every. single. day._**

**Let's stop this madness!**

On November 5, 2012, I gave a presentation at the [Internet Masterminds](http://www.meetup.com/Internet-Masterminds/events/85682772/) meetup in Vancouver, Canada.

I talked about various secrets to saving time through efficiency and how to do it using HootSuite, a popular social media management dashboard. And all of that got filmed on camera (hence, this post).

In this recording, you will learn how to use HootSuite to **simplify, automate and supercharge** your presence on Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and even Google Plus.

**This presentation is particularly valuable to startups because the scarcity of both time and money makes efficiency critical for success.**

If you have never used HootSuite, you can [try it out for free](http://www.shareasale.com/r.cfm?b=363445&u=712693&m=37818&urllink=&afftrack=) (affiliate link).

**Here are the key takeaways from the presentaion:**



	
  1. 20% of your social media efforts drive 80% of the ROI. -- [Tweet this](http://clicktotweet.com/khmxL).

	
  2. You need to optimize your listening, engaging, publishing and measuring. Otherwise, you're wasting time.

	
  3. Using HootSuite the right way will allow you to save 25% – 50% of the time you spend of social media marketing.


Without further ado, here it is...
