Kick-starting a business is not an easy task. Before you even begin earning
revenue, you need to set out your business plan, get funding and build your
product, along with many other essential tasks.

In order to increase your projected revenue, you’ll also need an excellent
marketing plan that will give you access to the right audience. Implementing SEO
in your website design will help you to gain a higher level of visibility and you
should also see a spike in traffic thanks to it.

But what’s the best way to do this for a startup? Your SEO techniques should be
as white hat as possible, rather than dipping into the murky underworld of black
hat tricks that produce instant yet damaging results.

If you’re in the process of implementing an SEO plan for your startup business,
make use of these five white hat techniques.

## 1. Make On-Page SEO the Backbone of Your Strategy

A lot of startups head straight for content creation and social media in the
first stages of a new site, but that could be a big mistake. Without a solid
basis of technical (i.e. on-page) SEO, all of this will be meaningless.

Make sure your website can be crawled by search engines by giving it good architecture
that’s easy to navigate. The next step in your technical SEO process is to ensure
your pages are being indexed by Google. The aim of these two steps is to get your
pages to rank, so you can nudge higher up the SERPs (Search Engine Results Pages)
and beat your competitors.

With a backbone of technical SEO, you can grow the other aspects of your strategy
around it.

## 2. Use Social Media to Build Awareness

Social media is ridiculously powerful, but its main aim won’t be to generate
revenue. Instead, you can use it to encourage online conversation, which will
increase your brand awareness and follow through with the natural creation of
links. This is because as people share your content they’ll also link back to
your website.

Create a good social media strategy before your site goes live and implement it
from day one. A viral ad wouldn’t go amiss either, as the hype it could create
would ensure your brand’s name was on everyone’s lips.


For instance, The Santa Monica-based subscription company [Dollar Shave Club](//dollarshaveclub.com)
rocketed onto the market in 2012 with a hilarious video that quickly went viral.
The video, which used quirky humour to sell the company’s service, was shared
across social media sites almost instantly and racked up over
[4.75m views in just three months](//www.entrepreneur.com/article/224282).


This translated to 12,000 people signing up to Dollar Shave Club in just 48
hours, but that wasn’t the main aim of the ad. It was designed to go viral,
ensuring everyone knew the brand, and aiding the company by counting on the fact
that a number of people would link back to the Dollar Shave Club’s website when
sharing the video.


## 3. Implement a Strong Content Marketing Plan

Content marketing is one of the oldest tricks in the SEO book, but it’s not the
same as it used to be. Google’s rules regarding content have changed a lot since
the old days, so you’ll need to focus on creating useful, informative content.
Create content that people will find interesting, and which is more likely to be
shared over social media.

Your content marketing plan doesn’t only have to include written content either.
You could also create infographics and videos that will pique the interest of
more than a few bloggers you approach.

## 4. Give Your Site Good Content

Make sure that every single page on your site has meaningful content on it. Each
page should contain the relevant keywords you’re aiming to target, along with a
user-friendly layout.

People spend [less than a minute](//www.nngroup.com/articles/how-long-do-users-stay-on-web-pages/)
on a site before clicking off, which means your content needs to be top notch.
There’s no time for waffle and filler, you need to get straight to the point. What
does your business offer, why should people use your product or service, and how
can they find out more?


## 5. Set Up a Consistent Guest Blogging Program

Submitting guest posts to high quality blogs can become an invaluable part of your
link building scheme, and it’s often one of the most important aspects of it.

By becoming a regular guest blogger, you can build up a relationship with the blog
owner and anyone that replies to your post. By forging a relationship you can network
effectively, so you’ve a better chance of writing for guest blogs in the same network
later on.

If you set up your own blog you can then target long tail keywords that will help
to build your visibility and increase your audience. This is because these keywords
can be much more specific and they’re often much less competitive.


## Conclusion

Any SEO strategy for a startup needs to focus on white hat techniques that will
help to grow your business online. By mapping out your strategy as early on as
possible, you can get the jump on other startups that only get to grips with SEO
once they’ve been around for a few months.
