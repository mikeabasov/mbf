_Continuing the “[Twitter Monitoring Series](http://marketingbeforefunding.com/2010/09/05/how-to-monitor-everything-on-twitter/).” Check out the other parts, if you don't know how to do something I mention in this post._

You can learn a lot from your competitors. Businesses should monitor what is happening in the market, so here are a few things that make monitoring easy:



	
  1. **List your competitors.** Create a private list of your competition and a stream for it. See what they tweet about, how they act and how you can use that to your advantage.

	
  2. **Search for brand names.** Set up a search using the previous tips and examples to monitor what people are saying about your competition. Sometimes, they'll be looking for alternatives or complaining about bad service, and this is a great opportunity for your company to turn these people into your customers.


Here is an awesome search stream that _Toyota_ could use to monitor people talking about _Honda_ (see an opportunity in the first tweets?):
