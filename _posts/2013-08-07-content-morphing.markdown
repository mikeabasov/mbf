One of the most powerful marketing tools in the hands of an early-stage entrepreneur is content.

It can help you connect with your users in meaningful ways. It can get you on Google's radar. It's cheap. The best part &mdash; you can do it yourself.

But, of course, it's not all rainbows and unicorns. Creating great content takes a shitload of time. And time is one resource that we as founders and marketers have so little of.

**That's why I wanted to share with you a useful technique that will help you create 2&ndash;3 times more content without spending much extra time or money on it.**

I call it Content Morphing.

## What is Content Morphing?

**Content Morphing means reusing and adapting your existing content into different formats and channels, all while adding value to the end user.**

For example, think back to the last piece of content you produced. Maybe, it was a blog post or a video, or something else.

You probably spent at least a few hours making it, but what did you do with it after publishing? You probably shared it on social media. Maybe, you posted it on Hacker News and Redditâ€¦

*Doesn't it feel like a waste of your efforts to just leave it at that?*

Content morphing is about taking the message, the story, the essence of that original post or video and telling it in a different way.

It's turning that blog post into a slide deck to reach a new audience. It's disassembling that video into a dozen 140-character long quotes that get shared hundreds of times.

**I'll show you exactly how to do this in just a minute. For now, I want you to start thinking about any content you create as only a piece of the puzzle, not the whole thing.**

Here's a real world example. [Unbounce](//unbounce.com/) recently published a great ebook about [Conversion Focused Design](//unbounce.com).

The lazy thing to do would be publishing a blog post saying "Hey, here's the ebook, go get it!" But that wouldn't add much value to their blog readers, would it?

So instead, they ran a [full week worth of blog posts](//unbounce.com/) about this topic, all while promoting the main resource.

They talked about what conversion focused design is,  discussed pros and cons, and shared examples. They created lots of value for their readers without making them download anything.

*Seems difficult?* Well, remember that all these posts were based off of the ebook. The research has already been done. The definition has already been thought of. The examples have already been collected. This is content morphing at its best.

And now let's learn how we can do it ourselves.

## Putting Content Morphing to Work.

Content morphing isn't hard. The only challenge is to get into the habit of applying this approach every time you start working on something new.

That's why the first step is learning to see the whole spectrum of opportunities.

To help you with this, I'm going to share a framework and a worksheet which I've developed for myself and have been using for the last few months.

**The framework has two key dimensions:**

**1. Format.**
You can produce text, graphics, decks/presentations, audio, or video. It doesn't get more straightforward than this.

**2. User commitment.**
Some content takes only seconds to consume. For example, an image or a tweet. Reading a blog post, on the other hand, takes a few minutes. Finally, watching a live webinar or going to an event is a pretty big commitment.

When you put the two together, you end up with is a table just like the one embedded below. Let's call it a Content Morphing Framework.

[put it in]

This framework is empty now, and it's yours to fill out. I prefer printing it out, so [here's a PDF]().

#### Step 1:

Write down the working title of your content piece.

#### Step 2:

Start at the point of origin. Find a cell for it, and write down what exactly you're making.

For example, an ebook will land itself somewhere under text and graphics, and in the 15&ndash;60 minute commitment zone.

#### Step 3:

Brainstorm ways you can morph your original content into different formats and shapes.

Can you break it down into smaller pieces? Can you build it up into something massive?

If you find yourself struggling, [here are a few ideas](). But remember that these are just pointers, and there are lots of ways to fill out the worksheet.

#### Step 4.

Finally, select the content pieces you think you should be making and get to work!

Here's an important caveat, though. Moving from a low-commitment idea to a high-commitment one requires more work than going the other way. That's why it's best to start all the way at the top and move downwards.

## Content Morphing Case Study: 50 Must-Know Mobile Commerce Stats &amp; Facts

Before I let you go, I want us to go through another example of content morphing to illustrate exactly how powerful this approach is.

Our guinea pig is going to be a slide deck I created last month at Mobify. It's called "[50 Must-Know Mobile Commerce Stats and Facts](//www.mobify.com/go/)," and it was compiled by me and designed by our very talented [Andrew Wu](//myuniverseisyours.com).

The deck took a while to make (20+ hours at least), and it's only natural that I wanted it to get as much exposure as possible.

*Guess what I used? Content morphing, of course!*

In the filled out worksheet below you can see a number of things.

[put it in]

First, the origin point. I started with a slide deck that requires about 30 minutes to a user's time.

I then looked at ways to publish a blog post about the deck without just saying "hey, check this out." **Remember, we want to add value in every iteration of the content.**

The idea I decided to go with was "[13 Stats to Convince Your Boss to Invest in Mobile in 2013](//www.mobify.com/blog/)."

The headline had nothing to do with e-commerce, so I could target a wider audience. The deck itself was embedded at the very end.

Moving further down the table, I also decided to add "click to tweet" buttons within the post so that the content can get shared more easily.

Finally, knowing that our designer would do a great job with the graphics I thought that each slide of the deck could also be shared as separate updates on Facebook and Pinterest, highly visual platforms.

Note that none of these things took me much time. Blog post was written in an hour, not ten. Social media updates wrote themselves. Meanwhile, the total number of content pieces more than tripled.

#### The Results
To say the least, the results were great. The deck has been seen by over 18,000 people in less than a month. The post and the deck have been shared 800+ times combined and reposted on a number of cool blogs.

The highlight of the campaign was probably [this inforgraphic](//info.com) that a random company made based on the post. (And that's content morphing too, by the way.)

## Your Turn
Content morphing is a simple, yet powerful, way of thinking about your content. You may have been using it all along without knowing, but being aware of it and using it methodically will help you produce more content that could've imagined.
