On November 18, 2011, ten people were standing in the middle of the Segal School of Business’ lobby discussing their next move. Ahead of them were 2 intense days of building a mobile game that would change the way friends bet on sports games. There was an original idea, and now there was a team to execute it. I was a part of that team.

54 hours later, we would present an application named [EpicBets](http://epicbets.me) to the public, judges, and potential investors. We wouldn't get the first place, but we would win “Best Presentation” and, generally speaking, have a great time at [Startup Weekend Vancouver](http://www.tippett.me/).
