There is **one singe awesome tip** that will make it **incredibly easy** for you to get into conversations with people you follow (even when there are **a lot of them**) without reading tons of useless tweets.

I use _[HootSuite](http://hootsuite.com)_ for this, and I think that this is the** best tool ever**, but if you know some other app that you can use, go for it! On the image below you can see my **Home Feed** filtered by a keyword. **The keyword is a question mark.** This filter brings up questions which people that I follow are asking. And if there is a question, you can answer it!

It is this easy: in 2 clicks and 1 character I turned many tweets that I can't work with into a few engageable ones.
