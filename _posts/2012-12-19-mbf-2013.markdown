To say the least, the last couple of weeks have been insanely awesome. And although I don't usually talk about my personal life here on Marketing Before Funding, I feel like the news I have today is worth sharing.

**Plus, I wanted to talk to you about the future of this blog and the plans for 2013.**

I'll also ask you for a **quick favour at the very end** of the post. No, it won't cost you money. I just need a couple of minutes of your time.

### New Chapter: Mobify


As of last week, I am now a full-time marketing coordinator at [Mobify](http://mobify.com), one of the top Vancouver startup companies.

Mobify's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) software allows large brands, such as Starbucks, Beyond the Rack and Wired to easily and quickly adapt their desktop websites for any mobile or tablet device.

My role within the company is yet to be narrowed down, but for now I will be tackling a wide range of inbound marketing challenges.

Honestly, I couldn't be more excited.




### Marketing Before Funding in 2013


It's been abound 5 months since we've [launched](/2012/08/07/startup-marketing-priorities/) this small community of entrepreneurs and startup marketers. And the response from all over the world has been truly overwhelming.

For instance, here's an official US embassy shirt I received as a gift from a reader in Baghdad.

Cool, eh?

**What I'm trying to say is that I can't understate how grateful I am for your support and involvement!**

But you may be wondering if I'm going to quit MBF now that I am no longer riding solo (i.e. consulting / freelancing). The answer is "HELL NO!"

**I've always envisioned Marketing Before Funding as a long-term project with a simple goal: help as many entrepreneurs as possible build remarkable businesses. (I said "simple," not "easy.")**

This blog isn't about me. It's about _you_.

And I'll keep doing my best to provide you with great content in 2013 and beyond.

**Here's a quick list of things I'm planning for the next year:**



	
  * Practical "how-to" interviews with top startup marketers.

	
  * Guest posts from amazing growth hackers. And by the way, you can [write for MBF](/guest-post/) too.

	
  * Articles tackling PR, content marketing, SEO, getting interns, and other topics we haven't discussed yet.

	
  * In-depth courses (free and/or paid) on [social media for tech startups](/category/social-media/).


Trust me that there's lots of cool stuff in the works!
