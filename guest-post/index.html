    Want to write for MBF? Awesome! If you have some <strong>kick-ass content</strong>
    that our audience will enjoy, we'd love to publish it.
</p>

<p>
    <strong>Here are a few guidelines to follow:</strong>
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>Read our past posts.</strong> Notice how in-depth and
        actionable they are? These are the kinds of articles we're looking for.
        We're not into mind-numbing blocks of text or posts shorter than 500 words.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Stick to our topic.</strong> We only write about marketing for
        startup companies.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Keep your links in check.</strong> Link to anything useful and
        relevant, but please avoid any affiliate or self-promotional links.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Include a quick bio.</strong> Make it 2-3 sentences max and feel
        free to add links to your site or social media.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Send your post in HTML.</strong> The less formatting we have to
        do, the sooner your article will go live.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Submit via email.</strong> When you're ready to send your article,
        email it (as an attachment) to <em>misha [at] mishaabasov.com</em>.
        We'll respond as soon as we can.
    </li>
</ol>

<p>
    That's it. We hope to see a submission from you soon!
