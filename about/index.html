    Who said that marketing has to be expensive?
    Who said that only startups that get funded can make it big?
    Well, they are wrong!
</p>
<p>
    On <strong>Marketing Before Funding</strong>, we talk about how you can make
    your startup insanely successful using smart and effective marketing.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Here's what we believe in:</strong>
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
        <strong>"Build it and they will come" no longer works.</strong> That's
        why you need a new recipe for success.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Success isn't defined by the amount of money raised.</strong>
        It is defined by getting customers and real growth. For that you need
        marketing.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Marketing doesn't have to be expensive.</strong> Just as many
        others have done before, you can bootstrap your way to greatness.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    And this is where Marketing Before Funding comes in!
</p>
<p>
    Whether you're launching a startup or working at one, here you'll find 
    <strong>resources to help your company grow</strong>, and <strong>support
    from entrepreneurs and marketers</strong> who are on the same journey as you.
</p>
<p>
    We discuss <strong>strategies, tactics, and tools</strong> that can help
    make an impact and don't require wasting a shipload of cash. From building
    remarkable products and establishing powerful brands, to managing communities
    and dealing with the media, this blog covers it all.
