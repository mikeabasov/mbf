<p>2012 was a great year for startups, and there were plenty of cool articles, videos, blog posts and other resources created by marketing experts to help entrepreneurs grow their companies.</p>

<p><strong>So I decided to showcase the best of those resources and share them with you. They come from all over the web and are in different formats, but all of them are awesome!</strong></p>

<p>I then also took the liberty of adding a separate list of the Top 5 posts published on Marketing Before Funding this year.</p>

<p><strong>And if you think I&#39;m missing something, don&#39;t hesitate to leave a comment and add your own favourites.</strong></p>
