<p>As entrepreneurs, we often have to hustle hard to reach influential people in our industry.</p>

<p>Whether they are journalists, venture capitalists, or top level executives of big corporations, we know that a relationship with them could be beneficial for everyone, but first we have to get in touch with them.</p>

<p>So what do we do? </p>

<p>Sometimes, we get an introduction from a friend or an acquaintance. Other times, we catch our targets at a conference and elevator pitch the hell out of them.</p>

<p><strong>Often, however, there is no other way but to send a cold email.</strong></p>

<p>But you know what influential people all have in common? They rarely disclose their contact information.</p>

<p>For example, to write my &quot;<a href="http://marketingbeforefunding.com/2012/08/07/startup-marketing-priorities/">14 Renowned Experts […]</a>&quot; post, I had to reach out to about 60 influential founders and startup marketers in North America.</p>

<p>Of course, I didn&#39;t know most of them, so cold emailing was the way to go. But once I started researching my targets, I realized that I&#39;ll have to get creative to get their contact information.</p>

<p>And today I want to show you my method that will allow you to get any influencer&#39;s email address with a 99% success rate.</p>

<p>Ready? Let&#39;s do this!</p>

<h3>The Basics of Email Guessing</h3>

<p>First, let&#39;s discuss some basic assumptions.</p>

<p><strong>We&#39;re talking about influencers here, so they probably don&#39;t have email addresses such as pinkbunny1955@yahoo.com.</strong></p>

<p>They most likely have an email address under their companies&#39; domain names, and those companies are likely to have guidelines for creating emails.</p>

<p><strong>So, the email address will usually a) end with @company.com, and b) begin with something descriptive, such as a person&#39;s name or position.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Here are some of the most common corporate email structures:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>Firstname@company.com -- most founders use this format</p></li>
<li><p>Lastname@company.com</p></li>
<li><p>FistnameLastname@company.com + variations with &quot;.&quot; and &quot;_&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>FLastname@company.com + variations with &quot;.&quot; and &quot;_&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>FirstnameL@company.com + variations with &quot;.&quot; and &quot;_&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Position@company.com --  for example, &quot;CEO&quot;</p></li>
<li><p>Department@company.com --  for example, &quot;media&quot; or &quot;community&quot;</p></li>
</ul>

<p>And that&#39;s about it. Companies rarely get creative with this, which makes your and my jobs much easier.</p>

<h3>Using Rapportive to Go from Guessing to Knowing</h3>

<p>Now that you have a clear understanding of how companies come up with their emails, you can use one simple yet powerful technique (and tool) to turn your educated guesses into bulletproof knowledge.</p>

<p><strong><a href="http://rapportive.com/">Rapportive is a small Gmail plugin</a> which presents you with insights into people you&#39;re talking to. It is usually used to learn more about the person you&#39;re corresponding with, but it has other cool features as well.</strong></p>

<p>Go install it, I&#39;ll wait…</p>

<p>Now, if you click on someone&#39;s email in your <em>Compose window</em> or <em>Inbox</em>, a little widget on the right side of the page will appear and show you different social media profiles that are using that email address.</p>

<p>So if you enter your target&#39;s contact information, for example Firstname@company.com, Rapportive will try to find any connections between that email and the social web.</p>

<p>See where I&#39;m going with this?</p>

<p><strong>If the email address you&#39;re entering is real, it is highly likely that there are social media accounts associated with it. If your guess it wrong, however, Rapportive won&#39;t show anything.</strong></p>

<p>Here&#39;s an example, using my contacts…</p>

<p><img src="http://marketingbeforefunding.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-21-at-7.03.39-PM.png" alt="Rapportive Email Insights"></p>

<p>Now, all you need to do is test out every email address on your list and see which one is in use. It&#39;s that easy.</p>

<p>For example, when I was looking for the contact information of the 60 founders I&#39;ve mention in the beginning, it literally took me under 10 minutes to find most of them as they all used Firstname@company.com or Firstname.Lastname@company.com.</p>

<p>Go try it out for yourself…</p>

<h3>When Rapportive Fails</h3>

<p>Of course, Rapportive is no panacea.</p>

<p>Sometimes, the address you&#39;re looking for isn&#39;t connected to any social media. This often happens when a person is a new addition to the company.</p>

<p><strong>But, fortunately, I have a few backup plans for you…</strong></p>

<h4>Backup plan #1: Research your target.</h4>

<p>As you may have noticed, we haven&#39;t even started researching your target yet.</p>

<p><strong>So go open a new tab and google something like &quot;Name email address&quot; or &quot;Name contact info.&quot; You may find your answers on forums, blogs and even Quora.</strong></p>

<p>If that doesn&#39;t work, check out the company&#39;s website, your target&#39;s personal blog and social media. Hopefully, you&#39;ll find what you&#39;re looking for.</p>

<h4>Backup plan #2: Try all of them.</h4>

<p>Still no luck?</p>

<p>Here&#39;s another idea. This one comes from Brian Wong of <a href="http://www.kiip.me/">Kiip</a>, and he has <a href="http://vimeo.com/23139843">used it successfully</a> to secure meetings with top influencers in the sturtup space.</p>

<p><strong>Remember the list of all possible emails we&#39;ve outlined above? Well, we&#39;re gonna contact ALL OF THEM!</strong></p>

<p>Just compose your message and then type in all of those variations into the &quot;Bcc&quot; field. Then, take the address with the most potential to be real and type it into the &quot;To&quot; field.</p>

<p><img src="http://marketingbeforefunding.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-21-at-6.42.05-PM.png" alt="Using Bcc to guess email adresses"></p>

<p><strong>This way, when you send your email, there&#39;s a high probability that at least one of the addresses will work, and you&#39;ll reach your target.</strong></p>

<p>At the same time, since the full list of emails is hidden, the person won&#39;t feel like you&#39;re spamming them.</p>

<h4>Backup Plan #3: If all else fails, go social.</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re reading this, it means that none of the above options worked, and your inbox is full of &quot;Delivery Failed&quot; messages.</p>

<p><strong>Here&#39;s when we go back to social media. And the most straightforward way would be sending the person a quick tweet and asking for their contacts.</strong></p>

<p>But if you want to avoid such premature outreach, you can try a couple of other paths as well.</p>

<p>First, you can add your marks on LinkedIn. If they approve your request, you&#39;ll get access to all of her contact information. But if they don&#39;t, you&#39;re facing a penalty from this social network.</p>

<p><img src="http://marketingbeforefunding.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-21-at-7.09.21-PM-590x433.png" alt="Gary Vaynerchuk&#39;s Contact Information on LinkedIn"></p>

<p>So before you click &quot;Connect,&quot; make sure that the person has 500+ contacts, which usually means that they aren&#39;t particularly selective about who makes her acquaintance.</p>

<p>Of course, you can also pay LinkedIn to get its premium InMail feature, but what I&#39;ve found is that lots of influential people don&#39;t check their messages often enough to justify the expense.</p>

<p>But let me know if you have more success with this.</p>

<p><strong>An alternative to LinkedIn would, of course, be Facebook.</strong></p>

<p>If you can find the person&#39;s profile, check if they have a short vanity URL. Mine, for instance, is <a href="http://facebook.com/abasov">facebook.com/abasov</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Now, every user who has such a nice looking link, gets a similar email address as well, such as abasov [at] facebook.com.</strong></p>

<p><img src="http://marketingbeforefunding.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Screen-Shot-2012-11-21-at-12.15.28-AM.png" alt="Sending Emails to Other Inbox on Facebook"></p>

<p>The messages you send to such addresses will land into the person&#39;s &quot;Other&quot; inbox. And truth be told, they often go unnoticed. So I would only use this tactic as the last resort.</p>

<p>Again, if you had tried everything and nothing worked (which is a ridiculously rare case), just ask the person directly on Twitter. I&#39;m yet to hear one &quot;no&quot; when doing this.</p>
